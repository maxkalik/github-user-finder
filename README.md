# A very primitive react app template

This template made for who wants to learn react. There are simple adjustments: `webpack 4`, `babel`, `scss` and `eslint` which will be a bit capricious for the first time but it will lead you to the strong and clean coding but anyway you can configure eslint for your needs.

To run
